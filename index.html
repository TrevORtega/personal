      <h5>Abstract</h5>
      <p>Throughout any programmer's professional career, there is a struggle to showcase
      in-depth projects and experiences while also mainting a sense of brevity for the sake of a recruiter's time and sanity.  
      While other works have also delved into this area, see <a href="https://www.github.com/trevortega">Github</a>, <a href=https://github.com/TrevORtega/TrevorOrtega/blob/master/Resume.pdf>Resume</a>,
      and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevortega">LinkedIn</a>, in this work we aim to explore the professional life 
      and accomplishments of Trevor Ortega at a level of depth and pragmatism that is previously unfounded.

        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Trevor Ortega is a Software Developer and Computer Vision
        Researcher who was born in New Mexico, raised in Arizona, and attending 
        University in Bellingham, Washington. Trevor became interested in 
        Computer Science in High School and has learned to hone his skills for
        building software through multiple internships (i.e. Jethro Mobile LLC, Faithlife Corporation, SPIE, Zillow) 
        as well as University courses at Western Washington University. Trevor also gained an passion
        in Machine Learning and Computer Vision after working on multiple research projects 
        under the advisement of WWU professor, Scott Wehrwein.
